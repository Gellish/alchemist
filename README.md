# Photoshop Prerelease Plugin (& Code) Exchange

Want to share your cool plugin in the prerelease? Here's the place to do it, and here's how.

* Create a new branch with your github name and the name of your project. For example, "kerrishotts/vanillaPlugin". (We need a way to disambiguate since we're all in the same repo here.)
* Commit your changes and push to your branch.

> **Do not send or merge pull requests to master**
>
> Instead, when sharing code, you can share from your branch. We will not merge any code back into
> master.

> **Do not rely on this repository as a backup for your code!** 
>
> This is just for sharing during the prerelease. After prerelease, we'll have other
> public ways for sharing, and this repo will likely be shuttered.
