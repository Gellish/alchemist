# Photoshop Prerelease Plugin (& Code) Exchange

Want to share your cool plugin in the prerelease? Here's the place to do it, and here's how.

* Create a new branch with your github name.
* You'll probably want to create a folder with your github name and some folders for your projects.
* Commit your changes and push to your branch.

> **Do not send or merge pull requests to master**
> Instead, when sharing code, you can share from your branch.

> **Do not rely on this repository as a backup for your code!** 
> This is just for sharing during the prerelease. After prerelease, we'll have other
> public ways for sharing, and this repo will likely be shuttered.
