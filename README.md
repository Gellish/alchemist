# Photoshop Prerelease Plugin Exchange

Want to share your cool plugin in the prerelease? Here's the place to do it, and here's how.

* Fork the repository to your own github account. It should come over as "Private".
* Create a new folder with your name (github, whatever is fine).
* Put your code in that folder, whether it be scripts, plugins in subfolders, etc.
* Submit a Pull Request back to this repository.

> **Do not rely on this repository as a backup for your code!** 
> This is just for sharing during the prerelease. After prerelease, we'll have other
> public ways for sharing, and this repo will likely be shuttered.
