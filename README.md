# Photoshop Prerelease Plugin (& Code) Exchange

Want to share your cool plugin in the prerelease? Here's the place to do it, and here's how.

* Create a new branch with your github name.
* Create a new folder in the root folder with your github name.
* Put your code in that folder, whether it be scripts, plugins in subfolders, etc.
* Submit a Pull Request from your branch back to master. An admin will be by to approve the request.

> **Do not rely on this repository as a backup for your code!** 
> This is just for sharing during the prerelease. After prerelease, we'll have other
> public ways for sharing, and this repo will likely be shuttered.
